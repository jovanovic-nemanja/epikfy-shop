***Epikfy Shop*** is an ecommerce project written in Laravel 5.5.* intended for building a friendly eStore either for startups or big companies.

In spite of ***Epikfy Shop*** seems to be a whole couple app, it is powered by its <a href="https://github.com/julioserpone/epikfy-framework" target="_blank">core shop</a> which is a package that allows you to build a complete e-commerce based application for your needs.

***Epikfy Shop*** is in current development, receiving a ```whole rewrite``` from top to bottom toward a more stable platform where you might feel comfortable to walk along with.

## Dashboard

Here, you will be able to manage the base information of your store, such as categories, products features and more.

At the moment, the panel just has the module to manage the store categories, products and products features. However, it is intended to be the replacement for ***wpanel***.

You will be able to visit this section by typing this address within your installed app, as so ```http://app.dev/dashboard```. Once the whole ***wpanel*** is migrated to it, we will be updating the references in the app. Remember, you will have to be logged in either as seller or admin.
